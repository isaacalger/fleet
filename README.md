# Fleet

Multi-project Claude Code backlog orchestrator: GitHub Issues in, reviewed PRs out.

The daemon polls registered repos for open issues labeled `fleet:ready`, claims each one into its own git worktree, runs it as a Claude Agent SDK session, and ends every ticket at a pull request for human review. Progress and blockers are written back to the issue as a single continuously-updated status comment.

## How a ticket flows

1. You file an issue — preferably via the "Fleet task" issue form (`sync-templates` stamps it into each repo's New Issue chooser; it prompts for problem/acceptance-criteria/verification and a `Depends on` field, parsed the same as a hand-typed `Depends-on: #12` line) — then label it `fleet:ready` (optionally `fleet:p1`/`p2`/`p3` for priority).
2. The daemon claims it (`fleet:in-progress`), creates a worktree + `fleet/<issue>` branch, and spawns a worker session with the issue text as its prompt. A `fleet:plan` issue instead spawns a read-only planning session that decomposes the epic into child tickets — see [Epic decomposition](#epic-decomposition-fleetplan) below.
3. The worker commits incrementally and finishes with a structured result.
4. Completed → branch pushed, PR opened, issue labeled `fleet:review`. Blocked → issue labeled `fleet:needs-input` with the worker's question in the status comment.
5. You review the PR (or answer the question and re-label `fleet:ready`). Changes-requested reviews or new inline comments on an open fleet PR are picked up automatically and resume the same session — see [Review feedback and recovery](#review-feedback-and-recovery).

## Setup

Requires Node >=24 — the daemon persists state via `node:sqlite`, verified to need no `--experimental-sqlite` flag on that version.

```bash
pnpm install
gh auth login        # the daemon shells out to gh for all GitHub access
cp fleet.config.example.json fleet.config.json   # then edit
pnpm daemon init-labels                          # creates fleet:* labels in each repo
pnpm daemon sync-templates                       # stamps the fleet skill, issue forms, + .mcp.json into each repo
```

`templates/` in this repo (the fleet-backlog skill and `.mcp.json` registration) is the source of truth for what each registered project carries; `sync-templates` copies the skill file as-is and merges only the `mcpServers.fleet` entry into each project's `.mcp.json`, leaving other servers untouched. Issue forms are generated rather than copied: a generic task form and an epic form land in every project's `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`, plus one task form per non-default profile in that project's own `fleet.yaml` (labeled `fleet:ready` + `fleet:type:<name>`) — a project with no `fleet.yaml` gets just the generic + epic forms. It only writes into working trees — review the diff and commit it in each project yourself. Rerun it after pulling fleet updates or after changing a project's `fleet.yaml` profiles.

## Deploying updates

```bash
pnpm daemon update              # pull, install, restart the running daemon now
pnpm daemon update -- --drain   # same, but request a drain-mode restart instead
```

This is a manual step — fleet never self-updates. It runs `git pull --ff-only` in the fleet repo root (aborting with a clear message rather than merging or rebasing if the tree has diverged or has local changes), then `pnpm install`, then `POST /api/daemon/restart` against the configured `dashboardPort` (below) — the same restart contract the supervisor understands, so live sessions abort and auto-resume on the next boot exactly like a stop-now/restart triggered from the dashboard. If the daemon isn't running, the pull and install still happen and the command exits 0 with a note to start it via `pnpm daemon:supervised`. `--config` is respected, same as the other subcommands.

## Running

```bash
pnpm daemon -- --dry-run --once   # poll and report what would be claimed; changes nothing
pnpm daemon -- --once             # one cycle: claim, run workers to completion, exit (no dashboard, so approvals auto-deny)
pnpm daemon                       # the real loop + dashboard at http://localhost:4400
pnpm typecheck                    # tsc for shared+daemon+mcp, then vue-tsc for the dashboard
pnpm test                         # vitest: daemon loop/state/github logic, worker contract guards, mcp client
```

Every `pnpm daemon` run installs dependencies and rebuilds the dashboard (via turbo, cached) before the daemon starts, so the served bundle is never stale. The daemon serves that dashboard and a REST/WS API:

- `GET /api/board` — board tickets (including a synthesized Done column of recently-closed tickets), plus the daemon's pause state and running count.
- `GET /api/digest?hours=24` — what happened across every project in the trailing window: completions, auto-merges, blocked/failed tickets, stale-claim releases, gate holds, and spend vs budget.
- `POST /api/daemon/pause` — `{ paused: boolean }`; toggles drain mode (below).
- `POST /api/daemon/shutdown` — `{ mode: "drain" | "now" }`; stops the long-running daemon (below). 409s if a shutdown is already in progress.
- `GET /api/tickets/:project/:issue` — a ticket's record plus a journal tail.
- `POST /api/tickets/:project/:issue/priority`, `POST /api/tickets/:project/:issue/restart`, `POST /api/tickets/:project/:issue/reply` — dashboard actions (reprioritize, force-restart, steer or resume a session).
- `POST /api/projects/:project/tickets` — file a new ticket (`{ title, body, priority?, ready?, dependsOn? }`); this is what the `@fleet/mcp` server and the fleet-backlog skill call so an agent can queue follow-up work without touching `gh` directly.
- `GET /api/projects/:project/backlog` — that project's current tickets (number, title, status, priority), for dedup checks before filing.
- `GET /api/approvals`, `POST /api/approvals/:id` — the approvals inbox: tool calls outside the worker allowlist and `AskUserQuestion` park here until the dashboard answers, or `approvalTimeoutMinutes` denies them.
- `/ws` — pushes `board-updated` / `approvals-updated` events (no payload; clients refetch).

For dashboard development, `pnpm dashboard:dev` runs Vite on :4401 proxying to the daemon.

The dashboard header has a **Pause/Resume** toggle (drain mode): while paused, the daemon claims nothing new and resumes nothing — no `fleet:ready` pickups, no review-feedback resumes, no stall recovery — but sessions already running are left to finish, and board polling plus merged-ticket cleanup keep going. The pause is persisted in `.fleet/fleet.db`, so it survives a daemon restart and is cleared only by an explicit resume. It's the same gate the plan usage-limit pause uses, so the two can't fight each other.

Ticket detail has a **Restart** button for stuck, stalled, or failed tickets: it force-closes the session and puts the issue back in `fleet:ready`, so the next cycle re-runs it from scratch. The fresh claim recreates the branch and worktree from `origin/<defaultBranch>`, which **discards the previous session's commits** — the dashboard confirms before firing.

Stopping the long-running daemon (`--once` runs need none of this) has two modes, both guarded against firing twice:

- **Drain** (`POST /api/daemon/shutdown` with `{ "mode": "drain" }`) enables the same pause as the dashboard's Pause toggle, then exits once every running ticket reaches a normal terminal state (review/needs-input/failed) — nothing is interrupted.
- **Stop now** (`{ "mode": "now" }`, and Ctrl+C / SIGTERM) aborts every live session immediately and leaves each interrupted ticket `stalled` with its session id intact and `autoResumed` cleared, so the next `pnpm daemon` boot auto-resumes every one of them exactly once instead of burning that budget recovering from an unclean stop.

Operational state lives in `.fleet/` — ticket records, the closed-ticket archive, and per-ticket session journals all in the SQLite database `fleet.db`. The source of truth for tickets is always GitHub.

## Filing tickets from inside a project

A registered project gets an MCP server (`@fleet/mcp`, registered via `.mcp.json`'s `fleet` entry — `sync-templates` stamps this in, pointed at this repo and the project's name) and a matching skill (`templates/fleet-backlog/SKILL.md`, stamped into `.claude/skills/fleet-backlog/`). Together they let an interactive session or another fleet worker queue follow-up work — a bug it noticed, a deferred refactor — as a real fleet ticket instead of losing it when the session ends:

- `fleet_query_backlog` — lists the project's current tickets, for a dedup check before filing.
- `fleet_file_ticket` — files a new ticket (`title`, `body`, optional `priority`, optional `ready` to file for human curation instead of immediate pickup, optional `dependsOn` issue numbers that hold it until they close).
- `fleet_board_status` — per-column counts across all projects, plus currently-running tickets and their latest activity.

All three are thin wrappers over the REST endpoints above; GitHub issues stay the single source of truth.

## Refining tickets

- **Comments are the refinement surface.** At claim time the worker's first prompt includes the issue body and every comment on it, read fresh — so adding a comment before a ticket is claimed is fully effective. Nobody needs to edit the original body for routine refinement.
- **Body edits are for genuine rescoping only** — reserve them for when the problem itself changed, not as a substitute for a comment.
- **Plan children default to not-ready.** Unless the project sets `planChildrenReady: true` (see [Epic decomposition](#epic-decomposition-fleetplan) below), a decomposed epic's child tickets are filed without `fleet:ready` — a human reviews each one and labels it ready themselves, becoming its natural owner. Tickets filed via the fleet-backlog skill work the other way: `ready` defaults to true (immediately pickable), and the filer passes `ready: false` when a ticket needs human curation first.
- **What "ready" means:** a self-contained problem statement, acceptance criteria, and verification steps — an agent with no other context could act on it without needing to ask a clarifying question first.
- **Intake lint enforces this mechanically.** Before claiming, fleet checks the body for a problem/acceptance-criteria/verification heading (problem only for `fleet:plan`); a body missing one is never claimed — it's flagged `fleet:needs-input` naming what's missing instead. Opt out per project with `intakeLint: false`.

## Epic decomposition (`fleet:plan`)

Labeling an issue `fleet:plan` runs it as a read-only planning session instead of a coding one: the worker explores the repo for context but never writes files or commits, and its structured result is a list of self-contained, PR-sized child tickets (each with a title, body, optional priority, and an honest `light`/`standard`/`elevated` tier guess) rather than a diff. On completion, fleet files each child as its own issue — tagged with its suggested tier label and, if the project sets `planChildrenReady: true`, `fleet:ready` immediately; otherwise a human labels children ready individually. The epic issue itself goes straight to `fleet:review` with the child list in its status comment, never opens a PR, and a blocked decomposition works exactly like a blocked coding ticket (question posted, session held open for a reply).

## Triage (`fleet:triage`)

Issues carrying no `fleet:*` label are invisible to the board by design — `listFleetIssues` fetches every open issue each cycle and discards the rest. Triage is the way one of those gets into the pipeline without a human writing the spec by hand.

With `triage: true` on a project, the dashboard's **Triage** panel lists its non-fleet open issues and offers an **Investigate** button per issue. Investigate does nothing but add a `fleet:triage` label; the ordinary claim loop picks it up on the next cycle, so pickup takes up to `pollIntervalSeconds`. Intake lint is bypassed for these claims — a triage candidate is by definition a half-formed issue, and producing the missing sections is the whole point.

The session runs read-only (the same `git commit` denial a `fleet:plan` session gets, on top of the usual push/PR/label restrictions) and invokes the vendored `systematic-debugging` skill that `sync-templates` stamps into each repo. Its structured result is a root cause, `file:line` evidence, a whole-number confidence percentage, and a spec with `## Problem` / `## Acceptance criteria` / `## Verification` sections.

On completion the spec is appended to the issue body and the issue is promoted to `fleet:ready` — plus its suggested tier label — when confidence is at or above `confidenceThreshold` (default 70) and `triageAutoPromote` is on. Everything else holds at `fleet:needs-input`: a confidence below the threshold, a blocked result, a session error, or a human having edited the issue body while the investigation ran. **Triage fails closed**, the inverse of machine review's fail-open, because a triage that promoted on a failure would start an unsupervised coding session on an undiagnosed bug.

That last case is worth spelling out. A triage session runs for minutes, so a human can edit the issue underneath it. Fleet hashes the issue body at claim time and re-checks it before writing; on a mismatch it leaves the body alone, posts the spec as a separate comment, and holds — regardless of confidence. Detection compares the body hash rather than the issue's `updatedAt`, because fleet's own label swaps, status-comment updates, and heartbeat refreshes all bump `updatedAt` during a normal run.

## Review feedback and recovery

A few things happen automatically without reclaiming a ticket from `fleet:ready`:

- **Machine review.** When a code worker reports completed, a cheap read-only reviewer session (running on `lightModel` if set, else `model`) reviews the branch diff _before_ anything is pushed or a PR is opened. It reports real defects only (no style nits, no test re-runs — those already ran in the worker session). Findings send the still-live worker back for exactly one fix round; then the ticket proceeds to `fleet:review` regardless, with the review outcome noted in the issue's status comment. A reviewer failure never blocks the ticket — it proceeds as if the review passed. Opt out per project with `machineReview: false`.
- **Review feedback.** Every cycle, tickets sitting in `fleet:review` are checked for changes-requested reviews or new inline comments on their PR. If there's fresh feedback (and the project hasn't set `autoAddressReviews: false`), the ticket's session resumes in its existing worktree/branch with the feedback as its next message; a watermark (`lastReviewHandledAt`) keeps the same feedback from being reprocessed.
- **Auto-merge.** Opt in per project with `autoMerge: true`. Every cycle, right after review-feedback handling, each `fleet:review` ticket with a PR is checked: an approval from an `approvers`-allowlisted login (case-insensitive, latest review per reviewer) with no outstanding changes-requested review from anyone, every reported CI check passed (a PR with no checks counts as green), and the PR reports `MERGEABLE`. If all hold, fleet merges it with `mergeMethod` and posts a status comment — the PR body's `Closes #N` closes the issue, and the existing merge-cleanup path takes it from there. A merge attempt that fails (branch protection, a race with a human merge, a transient `gh` error) is logged and retried next cycle rather than failing the ticket; a PR that turns out to already be merged is treated as success.
- **Stall recovery.** A ticket with no activity for `stalledAfterMinutes` (or orphaned by a daemon restart) is flagged `stalled` and then auto-resumed from its last session, once. A second stall on the same ticket is left for a human to look at.
- **Auto-elevate on failure.** A run that fails outright (not `blocked`) auto-retries once on the project's `elevatedModel`, if one is configured and `autoElevateOnFailure` isn't set to `false`. A second failure — now already elevated — falls through to `fleet:needs-input` normally.
- **Plan usage-limit pause.** If a session's own error text indicates the account's plan usage limit was hit, the whole daemon pauses (no new claims or resumes, across every project) until the parsed reset time plus `limitResumeSlackMinutes`, or `limitDefaultBackoffMinutes` if no reset time could be parsed out of the message. The ticket that hit the limit is left `stalled` so it resumes automatically once the pause lifts.

## Running multiple fleets on one repo

Fleet supports several people each running their own daemon against the same repo, coordinating entirely through GitHub — no shared server, database, or config between them.

- **Identity.** A daemon acts as whatever account its `gh` is authenticated as (`gh api user`, cached for the daemon's lifetime) — there's no separate "fleet identity" beyond that. Each operator runs their own `gh auth login` before starting their own daemon.
- **Routing.** Unassigned `fleet:ready` issues are a shared pool any daemon can claim. Assigning an issue routes it exclusively to that person's daemon — every other daemon skips an issue assigned to someone else. Claiming self-assigns the issue to the claiming account, so ownership is always visible on the issue itself, not just in local state.
- **Collision behavior.** Two daemons can race to claim the same issue in the same poll window, since the label swap and self-assign aren't atomic. Both self-assign, pause briefly, then read the assignee list back; if more than one login shows up, the lexicographically lowest one wins and the other unassigns itself and abandons the claim. This resolves automatically — no operator action needed.
- **Contributor floor.** Only issues authored by a repo collaborator with push access are claimed. Anyone can open an issue, but `fleet:ready` alone isn't enough to get a worker with Bash access running against it unless the author has push access — this is who can effectively file work for the fleet to pick up.
- **Stale claims.** Every status-comment update stamps a hidden heartbeat (daemon login + timestamp) from whoever is actively working a ticket, refreshed once it's more than half of `staleClaimMinutes` old. Each cycle, every daemon checks open `fleet:in-progress`/`fleet:needs-input` issues assigned to someone else; once the heartbeat (or the comment's creation time, if there's no heartbeat yet) is older than `staleClaimMinutes` (default 45), it unassigns the dead claim, posts a "released" status update, and returns the issue to `fleet:ready` for anyone to pick up. `fleet:review` tickets are exempt — the PR already exists there, so releasing the claim would only strand review-feedback automation, not any at-risk work.
- **Refinement + ownership.** The person who readies or assigns a ticket is its natural owner going forward. Teammates steer a ticket someone else's daemon is running the same way anyone refines a ticket — via issue comments, picked up fresh at claim time and injected mid-session if added later; see [Refining tickets](#refining-tickets).
- **What's shared vs. local.** Labels, assignees, issues, PRs, and status comments (heartbeat included) are shared coordination state on GitHub — every daemon reads and writes them. Everything else is per-daemon and local: worktrees, `.fleet/fleet.db`, journals, and the dashboard. In particular, approvals and blocked-ticket replies only exist on the dashboard of the daemon actually running that session — a ticket another daemon owns has nothing waiting in your approvals inbox or reply box, even though it still shows up on your board (board data comes from the shared GitHub issues, not local state).

## Config

See `fleet.config.example.json`. Top level: `worktreeRoot`, `pollIntervalSeconds`, `dashboardPort` (default 4400), `dataDir` (default `.fleet`), `claudeExecutable` (optional, overrides which Claude CLI binary workers run), `stalledAfterMinutes`, `ticketTimeoutMinutes` (per-turn timeout), `approvalTimeoutMinutes` (how long an approval or `AskUserQuestion` waits before auto-denying), `replyWaitMinutes` (how long a blocked ticket holds its session open for a dashboard reply before closing it resumable), `limitResumeSlackMinutes`/`limitDefaultBackoffMinutes` (plan usage-limit pause tuning, above), and `staleClaimMinutes` (default 45 — how long a peer daemon waits without a fresh heartbeat on another daemon's in-progress/needs-input claim before releasing it back to `fleet:ready`; keep it comfortably above both a normal restart window and `replyWaitMinutes`, since those tickets' heartbeats only refresh once per poll cycle).

`windowBudgetUsd` (optional, unset by default) turns on a rolling-window spend gate over new claims: fleet sums its own spend ledger (every recorded cost delta, timestamped) over the trailing `usageWindowHours` (default 5, mirroring the plan's own rolling window), and once that sum passes `budgetLightThreshold` (default `0.85`) of `windowBudgetUsd` it claims only `fleet:light`-labeled issues, and once it reaches `windowBudgetUsd` it claims nothing until spend ages out of the window. This only gates new claims — resumes and already-live sessions are never held back, and the reactive plan usage-limit pause above remains the hard backstop. It's a self-estimate, not a guarantee: interactive Claude use on the same plan is invisible to fleet, so treat it as a governor rather than a hard ceiling.

`workHoursReserve` (optional, unset by default) holds all new claims for `reserveHours` immediately before `workStart` (local machine time, `HH:MM`) on each of `days` (default Mon–Fri), so the plan's usage window is back at full capacity when the human's workday begins. A window that crosses midnight (e.g. `workStart: "01:00"`, `reserveHours: 3`) is gated on the day work _starts_, not the day the window begins. Only claims are held — resumes and already-live sessions finish normally, same as the budget gate above.

`notifications` (optional, unset by default — the whole feature is a no-op with zero network calls until configured) posts a compact Discord message via `discordUrl` (a Discord webhook URL) whenever something happens that a human would want to hear about without having the dashboard open: `needs-input` (a ticket is blocked, or a post-completion step failed and needs manual resolution), `pr-opened`, `failed` (a terminal failure, not an auto-elevate retry), `paused` (a plan usage-limit pause is newly set or extended), `auto-merged`, and `stale-released` (a peer daemon's dead claim was released back to the pool). `events` (optional, default: all of the above) restricts which events post. Each message names the project, issue, ticket title, a one-line detail, and a link. A webhook failure (bad URL, non-2xx, network error) is logged once and never affects the ticket's own path. Notifications never fire under `--dry-run` or `--once`.

`notifications.digestTime` (optional, `HH:MM` local machine time) posts a once-a-day compact digest — tickets completed/blocked/failed, PRs auto-merged, stale claims released, gate holds, and spend vs budget, each grouped by project over the trailing 24h — to the same Discord webhook. Unset `digestTime` falls back to `workHoursReserve.workStart` (below) when that's configured, so the digest lands as the workday begins; with neither set, no digest is ever posted. The daemon checks once per poll cycle whether today's `digestTime` has passed and nothing has been sent since, so a send is restart-safe (no double-post). The dashboard's digest panel (`GET /api/digest?hours=24`) works regardless of whether `notifications` is configured at all.

Per project: `repoPath` (local clone), `githubRepo` (`owner/repo`), `defaultBranch`, `maxConcurrent`, `maxInReview` (default 3 — claiming holds once this many issues are labeled `fleet:review`, so the review queue can't outpace a human reviewer), optional `setupCommand` (run in each fresh worktree, e.g. `pnpm install` — ignored when the target repo declares its own `fleet.yaml`, below), optional `model`/`elevatedModel`/`lightModel` and `allowedTools` overrides, optional `effort`/`elevatedEffort`/`lightEffort` (reasoning-effort tiering — `low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max`, layered the same way as the model fields; unset at any tier falls back to the SDK's own default rather than a sibling field), `planChildrenReady` (default off — file `fleet:plan` children straight into `fleet:ready`), `autoElevateOnFailure` (default on), `autoAddressReviews` (default on), `machineReview` (default on — pre-review every completed code ticket with a cheap model before human review), `triage` (default off — enable the Triage panel and `fleet:triage` claiming for this project), `confidenceThreshold` (default 70 — the whole-number confidence percentage every scored session must reach to proceed, governing triage, plan, code, machine review, and plan review; below it the ticket holds in `fleet:needs-input`, and applying `fleet:confidence-overridden` carries one stage past the gate), `triageAutoPromote` (default on — whether a triage clearing the threshold is auto-promoted to `fleet:ready`; off always holds triage for human review), `intakeLint` (default on — deterministic pre-claim check that the body has problem/acceptance-criteria/verification sections, above), `autoMerge` (default off — merge a `fleet:review` PR automatically once it's approved, green, and mergeable; see below), `approvers` (default: the account the daemon's `gh` is logged in as), `mergeMethod` (default `squash`), and optional `notifications` (same `discordUrl`/`events` shape as the top-level block above, unset by default). A project's `notifications` is resolved per-field against the top-level one — `discordUrl` and `events` each independently fall back to the global value when the project doesn't set them, so a project can redirect just the webhook URL and keep inheriting the global event filter, or override both. This only routes per-ticket event pings; the daily digest (`postDigest`) is daemon-wide and always posts to the top-level `discordUrl`, never a project override.

## Worktree provisioning: `fleet.yaml`

A target repo can self-describe its own setup instead of the fleet operator encoding it in `setupCommand`, by committing a `fleet.yaml` to its root:

```yaml
# Simple repo — a bare step list, run in order
setup:
    - name: install
      run: pnpm install
```

```yaml
# Monorepo — named profiles, selected per ticket
setup:
    default:
        - name: install
          run: pnpm install
    frontend:
        - name: install
          run: pnpm install
        - name: build-storybook
          run: pnpm --filter web build-storybook
    backend:
        - name: install
          run: pnpm install
        - name: test-db
          run: pnpm db:migrate:test
    docs:
        setup:
            - name: install
              run: pnpm install
        tier: light
```

In map form a `default` profile is required; every other key becomes a selectable profile. A profile can also be written as an object (`{ setup, teardown, contract, review, verify, tier }`) instead of a bare step list, to declare `teardown:` steps (below), a `contract:`/`review:` markdown appendix, `verify:` commands, and/or a default model `tier:` for tickets of that type (below). The daemon reads `fleet.yaml` from the **fresh worktree**, after `git worktree add` and before the worker session starts — provisioning stays fully deterministic and daemon-side, with no agent or model involvement.

**Profile selection** is driven by a `fleet:type:<name>` label on the issue: `fleet:type:frontend` selects the `frontend` profile. No type label, or one that names a profile the file doesn't declare, falls back to `default` (a warning is logged for the unknown case; the claim is never failed for it). Multiple type labels pick the first match in alphabetical order and log a warning about the ambiguity. `pnpm daemon init-labels` creates a `fleet:type:<name>` label for every profile a repo's `fleet.yaml` declares (skipping `default`) — per-repo, not part of the global `fleet:*` label set.

**Per-worktree resources: `teardown:` and `FLEET_*` variables.** Setup and teardown steps run with `FLEET_ISSUE` (issue number), `FLEET_PROJECT` (project name), and `FLEET_WORKTREE` (absolute worktree path) in their environment, so a step can provision resources unique to its worktree — e.g. `docker compose -p ${FLEET_PROJECT}-wt-${FLEET_ISSUE} up -d`. An object-form profile's optional `teardown:` list (same `name`/`run`/`allowFailure` step shape as `setup:`) releases those resources when the worktree is discarded: cleanup after the PR merges/closes, an operator restart, or a re-claim replacing the previous attempt's worktree — and on daemon startup for any ticket whose worktree is already gone but whose teardown never ran (a crash between removal and teardown). Teardown is wholly best-effort: a failing step is logged and the remaining steps still run, never blocking the ticket. For untyped tickets the `default` profile's `teardown:` applies, mirroring the setup fallback. A `fleet.yaml` with no `teardown:` keys behaves exactly as before — nothing new runs anywhere.

**Precedence:** `fleet.yaml` present in the worktree wins outright — `setupCommand` is ignored for that claim. No `fleet.yaml` → `setupCommand` behaves exactly as before (including being a no-op when unset). A malformed `fleet.yaml` (bad YAML, or schema-invalid — e.g. a profile map missing `default`) fails the claim with the problem named in the status comment and daemon log; it never silently falls back to `setupCommand`, since that could mask a broken spec indefinitely. A step that fails also fails the claim, naming which step failed (e.g. `setup step "build-storybook" failed: ... (exit 1)`).

## Skills, agents, and models

Workers load each project's own `.claude/` setup (`settingSources: ['project']`): CLAUDE.md instructions, **skills** (`.claude/skills/`), and **subagents** (`.claude/agents/`) all work inside worker sessions, auto-triggering from their descriptions exactly like interactive Claude Code. The `Skill`/`Agent` tools are in the default worker allowlist.

Model selection is layered, most specific wins:

1. **Skills and agents in the repo** — `model:` frontmatter in a SKILL.md or agent .md pins the model for that skill/agent's work. This is the recommended place to encode "this kind of task needs this model."
2. **`fleet:elevate` label** on an issue — runs that ticket's session on the project's `elevatedModel` (config). Add the label + reply to a blocked ticket to retry harder with a stronger model. Wins over `fleet:light` if both are present.
3. **`fleet:light` label** on an issue — runs that ticket's session on the project's `lightModel` (config), for cheap mechanical work (doc tweaks, renames, small sweeps). No-op without `lightModel` configured. A `fleet:plan` decomposition can tag a child ticket's suggested tier when it judges the work light or elevated; standard tier gets no label.
4. **A type's `tier:` in `fleet.yaml`** (see above) — a map-form profile can declare `tier: light` or `tier: elevated` (or `tier: default`, same as omitting it) so every ticket of that type defaults to that tier without a human or planner adding a label. An explicit `fleet:elevate`/`fleet:light` label on the issue still wins over this.
5. **Per-project `model`** in the config — the session default for all of that project's workers; unset means the Claude CLI's configured default.

The model actually used shows on each board card and in ticket detail, with a per-model token/cost breakdown after each run (subagent models included).

Reasoning effort (`low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max`) is an orthogonal, cheaper lever than swapping models: it's selected the same way — `fleet:elevate` → `elevatedEffort`, `fleet:light` → `lightEffort`, otherwise the project's `effort` — but each tier is independently optional, so an unset field falls back to the Agent SDK's own default rather than to a sibling tier. Machine/plan review sessions prefer `lightEffort ?? effort`, matching how they already prefer the light model.
