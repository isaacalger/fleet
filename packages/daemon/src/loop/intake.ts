 * `fleet:ready` → `fleet:needs-input` swap, run before `processTicket` ever
 * gets a chance to swap the label to `fleet:in-progress`. The body is read
 * fresh off `issues` (not cached), so re-adding `fleet:ready` after fixing it
 * re-lints cleanly next cycle. `project.intakeLint === false` is a full
 * bypass, restoring pre-lint behavior.
